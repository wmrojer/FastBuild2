# FastBuild2
Minecraft Mod for faster building. When you place blocks it places more blocks in the direction you where placing the block. How many it places is configurable with the config and in game command.

This a forge version for Minecraft 1.7.10 of chasesandrgn FastBuild 2.0 found at http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-mods/1272421-

DESCRIPTION

Alright, here is the short of it for you.

Hold control and place a block, it will place as many as possible in that direction till it hits something or you run out of blocks to place. Very useful for bridge building. Even in creative, it will only place as many block as as you have in the stack!

It can do both vertical and horizontal placement. It modifies only the ItemBlock class only. Not many mods do this (that I know of), so should be fairly compatible.
